I needed to reserve a Java package namespace, and I needed a web address for some AWS services. I had set up a minimal landing page, but I had always wanted to evolve it into a professional showcase for my work, hobbies, and personal perspectives. Yet, as the old adage goes, the cobbler’s children often go barefoot; my professional focus left my own digital presence neglected. According to web archives, the site has been nothing more than a static hero image since at least December 2020."

Recovering from spinal surgery and newly free of a six-week, pain-medication-induced brain fog, I sought distraction by immersing myself in music videos from the mid-2010s. This sudden dose of colorful optimism, or perhaps the post-medication clarity, (or perhaps both) led to an intense fixation on color palettes, visual morphisms, and other aspects of design that encompass more of our lives than we realize. I developed an urgent drive to build something that would bring this specific aesthetic vision to life."

            "text": "However, the initial development proved challenging. I pursued an overly ambitious direction: creating my own custom CSS library—a sort of private-label Bootstrap. Though I began learning SASS for this purpose, I quickly realized my technical mind struggled to translate abstract ideas into a consistent, visually appealing, and externally engaging design. I could nearly see the finished product, but the goalposts seemed to shift with every step forward."

But the back burner is often where ideas are allowed to simmer. I finally liberated myself from the notion that I needed a custom, gradient-glassmorphic framework, enabling me to focus on the site’s content."

While I don't adhere to New Year’s resolutions, a stretch of boredom and free time rekindled the project. This time, I had better tools: JetBrains IDEs had expanded their free features, I’d gained experience with AI coding agents, and most importantly, I’d accepted that I didn't need to build every element from scratch. I decided to delegate the initial construction to AI."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "My initial request for a personal webpage covered four specific interests: Software Engineering, Numismatics (coin collecting), Mass Transit, and Electronics. The resulting design was mostly successful, though it required some notes for later revision. For instance, the requested schematic diagram background generated a simple grid pattern instead. However, the AI's design for the four &quot;Interests&quot; cards was clean and distinct, effectively using simple text and Font Awesome icons in standard Bootstrap colors. When I requested four sections with mock stories, I was impressed that the AI provided contextual text instead of generic &quot;Lorem Ipsum.&quot; The main difficulty arose when I requested a &quot;Netflix&quot; style layout with side-scrolling articles; the AI failed to deliver this visual structure, a miss I attributed to my own lack of clarity in the prompt."

            "text": "The next major task—converting the project into a reusable React application—proved tedious. The LLM took an agonizing amount of time, prompting for permissions repeatedly. It worked so slowly that I managed to make and consume a ten-minute microwave dinner (thanks to &quot;Chef Mike&quot;) while waiting for it to complete the task—ten minutes being an eternity in computing time."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "A pivotal moment came during an attempt to refine the article sections: the AI failed the refactoring, destroying the layout. I could only restore it to an approximation of its former state. This served as a strong lesson, prompting me to immediately create a Git repository to manage changes via dedicated branches."

While the AI successfully handled the image resize, it missed the mark on the padding adjustment, forcing me to handle that detail manually."

            "text": "The journey from a static placeholder to a dynamic, if partially AI-built, React application demonstrated the complexity of co-piloting with modern LLMs. The front-end creation for the article pages, which currently serve JSON data from a GitHub repository using GitHub Pages, was a seamless process thanks to mock data. While the backend solution is temporary—I plan to create a custom app for writing and uploading articles in the future—the process proved that while AI can handle significant chunks of the build, the critical tasks—the final polish, the precise refactoring, and the effective articulation of complex technical requirements—remain firmly within the domain of the human developer."

Given that AI was used for the web page creation, it is fitting to use AI again to transform project notes into a comprehensive article. This will serve as the site's first piece of content, providing a satisfying bookend to the development process."
