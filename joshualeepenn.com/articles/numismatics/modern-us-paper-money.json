Cash is still in high enough demand that the US government prints and mints hundreds of billions of dollars of cash every year. Despite its waning popularity, most businesses still accept cash. Most people will accept cash as payment. Some things can only be paid for in cash. Some people only use cash and can not or will not use banking, let alone digital payments. Even other nations hold United States Federal Reserve Notes (the full government name for what we call Dollar Bills.)"

            "text": "US paper money has been relatively static. Millennials and older generations will likely remember when all the paper money had the same style, but then the larger-value bills received small changes over 2 iterations. Despite the recent changes in looks, US paper money hasn’t changed much since 1928. The same presidents and Founding Fathers who are on the $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills now were the same ones back then. The modern portraits on the $5 and higher denominations are based on those older portraits."

Changing who issued the currency, changing the monetary backing, changing the color of the serial number, preparing to declare currency worthless as an emergency measure, and changing the available denominations were some of many changes that reflected changes behind the scenes.

Whether you come away with a fun fact or I spark your interest into numismatics, I will have done my job."
