<!-- The case for reviving the $500 bill -->

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We all know the ubiquitous $100 dollar bill. It's the largest denomination of United States Federal Reserve Note (the
    full government name of a Dollar Bill) available at banks. Whether you're receiving one in a birthday card, using
    one to light a cigar, or want to appear richer than you really are, the Hundred Dollar Bill is known for its status
    of wealth. But the iconic piece of legal tender has not always been the biggest bill.</p>

<h2>The rise and fall of big bills</h2>

<p>In the past, the United States has printed $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 notes. The need for these larger
    denominations came about as our nation grew and faced challenges. We needed to be able to transfer larger amounts of
    money, and the most-used way to transfer it was with physical cash. Larger-denomination notes were easier to
    transfer and quicker to count than smaller denominations. The $500, $1,000, and $5,000 bills were first used in 1861
    as a way to finance the Civil War. The $10,000 bill was introduced in 1878 and with the purpose of transferring
    money between banks.</p>

<p>Over time, advances in technology have replaced cash. The advent and adoption of the telegraph paved the way for the
    first wire transfers. Newfound prosperity after World War II resulted in the widespread use in checks, with
    customers opting to keep their money secure in banks. Due to declining use and fears of crime and tax evasion, in
    1969, The US Treasury and Federal Reserve discontinued and began withdrawing bills larger than $100.</p>

<h2>A case for reversing course</h2>

<p>Average rent for the year 1969 was $135/month. A combination of a $100-, a $20-, a $10-, and a $5 bill could have
    been transferred from a tenant to a landlord. In 2025, the average rent was a bit over $1,700, which is 17 $100
    bills. Accounting for inflation, it takes $880.77 to equal the same buying power that a $100 bill had in 1969. We
    passed the $500 mark in March 2003.</p>

<p>One could argue that since larger transactions are now mostly handled digitally or by check, that the US would not
    benefit from enough from a larger denomination to justify the costs associated with printing and accommodating a
    new, larger denomination and that the old denomination still serves fine. However, the average $100 bill user is not
    the average person. Two-Thirds of the $100 bills are held outside of the United States.</p>

<p>Due to its stability and status in international trade, the US dollar is held by foreign entities. These
    international transactions are often in millions or billions of US dollars, so it brings logistical problems like
    how to transport or securely store the money. One million dollars in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds. $5 million becomes
    an OSHA safety hazard at 110 pounds. Using $500 bills for the same amount of money would reduce the weight and
    volume by 80%. To put that reduction into perspective, it's about the same as the reduction in energy used when
    switching from an incandescent light to an LED light.</p>

<p>But for the remaining one-third of $100 bill holders in the US, A $500 bill would still be a welcome addition. While
    it likely wouldn't eclipse the ubiquitous $100 bill, a $500 bill raises the bar for gifts and showing off, while
    also offering a more practical way to pay rent or a car payment, two of our largest expenses and which could
    reasonably be paid with at least one $500 bill. For some consumers, this could also be their groceries or a utility
    bill. It could be a relative paying for a young adult's college meal plan or a down payment on a modest used car. It
    could be the lame excuse you use to be too cheap to pay for your friend's burger (“Sorry, I don't want to break a
    $500”).</p>

<h2>Equal footing</h2>

<p>Other countries with stable currencies have also reduced their large denominations, and for similar reasons as the
    United States did in 1969. However, the denominations, when converted to US dollars, can vary from about $70 to
    $7,000. While the British Pound's largest denomination is £50, which is equivalent to about $67 in US Dollars, the
    Singapore Dollar has a S$10,000 note that's equivalent to $7,800 in US Dollars. The Euro, the Swiss Franc, the
    Brunei Dollar, and the Singapore Dollar all have denominations in circulation which convert to over $100 USD. And
    while different countries can have different rules, it seems that these countries do not think crime or tax evasion
    is enough of a problem to justify recalling their large denomination notes. Adding a $500 denomination will bring us
    more in line with world leading currencies.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The United States once had a need for $500 bills, even when $500 was a lot of money. However, disuse of cash and
    fears of illegitimate business dealings caused the recall of higher denominations. However, because some people
    still need or want to use cash, and because the US dollar is so popular overseas that the largest denomination is
    mostly used for this trade, it's time to reevaluate bringing back the $500 bill.</p>
