<h3>Backstory (or, Why I didn't already have a web page)</h3>

<p>When I first secured the joshualeepenn.com domain, it was a purely functional decision.I needed to reserve a Java
  package namespace, and I needed a web address for some AWS services. I had set up a minimal landing page, but I had
  always wanted to evolve it into a professional showcase for my work, hobbies, and personal perspectives. Yet, as the
  old adage goes, the cobbler’s children often go barefoot; my professional focus left my own digital presence
  neglected. According to web archives, the site has been nothing more than a static hero image since at least November
  2020.</p>

<p>The catalyst for change arrived unexpectedly on January 6, 2025. Recovering from spinal surgery and newly free of a
  six-week, pain-medication-induced brain fog, I sought distraction by immersing myself in music videos from the
  mid-2010s. This sudden dose of colorful optimism, or perhaps the post-medication clarity, (or perhaps both) led to an
  intense fixation on color palettes, visual morphisms, and other aspects of design that encompass more of our lives
  than we realize. I developed an urgent drive to build something that would bring this specific aesthetic vision to
  life.</p>

<p>However, the initial development proved challenging. I pursued an overly ambitious direction: creating my own custom
  CSS library—a sort of private-label Bootstrap. Though I began learning SASS for this purpose, I quickly realized my
  technical mind struggled to translate abstract ideas into a consistent, visually appealing, and externally engaging
  design. I could nearly see the finished product, but the goalposts seemed to shift with every step forward.</p>

<p>Eventually, the project was placed on the back burner. Returning to my job, recovering from a bout of COVID, and
  prioritizing family and health necessitated the pause. But the back burner is often where ideas are allowed to simmer.
  I finally liberated myself from the notion that I needed a custom, gradient-glassmorphic framework, enabling me to
  focus on the site’s content.</p>

<h3>Vibe coding to the rescue!</h3>

<p>The thought of wanting a personal web page crept back into my head on January 1, 2026. While I don't adhere to New
  Year’s resolutions, a stretch of boredom and free time rekindled the project. This time, I had better tools: JetBrains
  IDEs had expanded their free features, I’d gained experience with AI coding agents, and most importantly, I’d accepted
  that I didn't need to build every element from scratch. I decided to delegate the initial construction to AI.</p>

<p>My initial request for a personal webpage covered four specific interests: Software Engineering, Numismatics (coin
  collecting), Mass Transit, and Electronics. The resulting design was mostly successful, though it required some notes
  for later revision. For instance, the requested schematic diagram background generated a simple grid pattern instead.
  However, the AI's design for the four <q>Interests</q> cards was clean and distinct, effectively using simple
  text and Font Awesome icons in standard Bootstrap colors. When I requested four sections with mock stories, I was
  impressed that the AI provided contextual text instead of generic <q>Lorem Ipsum.</q> The main difficulty arose
  when I requested a Netflix-style layout with side-scrolling articles; the AI failed to deliver this visual
  structure, a miss I attributed to my own lack of clarity in the prompt.</p>

<p>The next major task—converting the project into a reusable React application—proved tedious. The LLM took an
  agonizing amount of time, prompting for permissions repeatedly. It worked so slowly that I managed to make and consume
  a ten-minute microwave dinner (thanks to <q>Chef Mike</q>) while waiting for it to complete the task—ten minutes
  being an eternity in computing time.</p>

<p>A pivotal moment came during an attempt to refine the article sections: the AI failed the refactoring, destroying the
  layout. I could only restore it to an approximation of its former state. This served as a strong lesson, prompting me
  to immediately create a Git repository to manage changes via dedicated branches.</p>

<h3>Lessons in Prompt Engineering</h3>

<p>My experience highlighted essential rules for working with AI coding agents: first, use sequential iteration, as
  attempting to implement too many changes simultaneously only confused the AI, leading to unexpected results; second,
  always verify changes, as sometimes a requested change would result in no visible difference on the page. I struggled
  initially with the power of precise language, trying to ask how to use variables for my interest section titles to
  enable string reuse, with common search terms yielding information on local .env files. The breakthrough came when I
  asked: <q>I want to use variables for the interest title values so I can reuse those strings in other places.</q>
  With the proper context, the AI immediately provided the correct solution.</p>

<h3>A helping (human) hand</h3>

<p>The final stages involved minor tweaks, such as increasing the hero image size and adding padding to prevent scroll
  arrows from overlapping the article cards. While the AI successfully handled the image resize, it missed the mark on
  the padding adjustment, forcing me to handle that detail manually.</p>

<p>The journey from a static placeholder to a dynamic, if partially AI-built, React application demonstrated the
  complexity of co-piloting with modern LLMs. The front-end creation for the article pages, which currently serve JSON
  data from a GitHub repository using GitHub Pages, was a seamless process thanks to mock data. While the backend
  solution is temporary—I plan to create a custom app for writing and uploading articles in the future—the process
  proved that while AI can handle significant chunks of the build, the critical tasks—the final polish, the precise
  refactoring, and the effective articulation of complex technical requirements—remain firmly within the domain of the
  human developer.</p>

<h3>The next steps</h3>

<p>With the website UI complete, two final steps remain: establishing a long-term content delivery method and actually
  generating the content itself. Given that AI was used for the web page creation, it is fitting to use AI again to
  transform project notes into a comprehensive article. This will serve as the site's first piece of content, providing
  a satisfying bookend to the development process.</p>
