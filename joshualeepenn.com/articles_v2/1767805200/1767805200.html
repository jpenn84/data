<!-- Modern US Paper Money -->

<h3>Cash is, or at least was, king</h3>

<p>Cash, while not as popular as it once was, is still a major part of our lives. Cash still accounts for about 1 in
    every 7 day-to-day transactions. Cash is still in high enough demand that the US government prints and mints
    hundreds of billions of dollars of cash every year. Despite its waning popularity, most businesses still accept
    cash. Most people will accept cash as payment. Some things can only be paid for in cash. Some people only use cash
    and can not or will not use banking, let alone digital payments. Even other nations hold United States Federal
    Reserve Notes (the full government name for what we call Dollar Bills.)</p>

<p>Author’s note: Personally, I see YOUR preferred payment method being the best payment method FOR YOU, and will
    therefore not opine on the matter. However, as a numismatist, I must disclose that I always favor the existence of
    physical currency for reasons directly related to the hobby of numismatics.</p>

<p>Paper money has been around for thousands of years and provides a nearly universal experience: you possess a document
    made of paper (or plastic or linen or perhaps something else) that conveys a value that has been agreed upon by all
    who use it. We all know what paper money is, even if we seldom use it.</p>

<p>US paper money has been relatively static. Millennials and older generations will likely remember when all the paper
    money had the same style, but then the larger-value bills received small changes over 2 iterations. Despite the
    recent changes in looks, US paper money hasn’t changed much since 1928. The same presidents and Founding Fathers who
    are on the $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills now were the same ones back then. The modern portraits on the
    $5 and higher denominations are based on those older portraits.</p>

<p>But even in that relatively static time, there were a lot of changes. Changing who issued the currency, changing the
    monetary backing, changing the color of the serial number, preparing to declare currency worthless as an emergency
    measure, and changing the available denominations were some of many changes that reflected changes behind the
    scenes.</p>

<p>My series on Modern US Paper Money will explore a world which we are all familiar with, but from another point of
    view. I’ll break down the reasons why money looks the way it does today, and what it could mean for our future.
    Whether you come away with a fun fact or I spark your interest into numismatics, I will have done my job.</p>
